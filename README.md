## 3D & Metaverse

### 2023 | UltraHaptic door handle(PoC)

We have implemented a concept of a virtual door handle using the UltraHaptic Device. The UltraHaptic is a device consisting of an array of small speakers capable of producing ultrasonic output. By causing resonance through the phase difference of the speaker sound, it can produce tactile feedback in the user's hand. With this device, users can virtually grab a door handle in space and open or close a virtual door without physically touching it (contactless virtual door handle). 

This was developed as a proof of concept, and consists of the UltraHaptic device, a PC connected to it, a screen displaying virtual objects, and a control server to control the device that opens the actual door.

- UltraHaptic Device, Ubuntu, MacOS

- Unity, UltraHaptic SDK, Python
